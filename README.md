# ML-Project
Prediction of Diabetes using the patient symptoms.
Name of team member - Rachit, Anupam, Manish, Alok

* For classification we have many options to choose like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Neural networks, Random forests, K Nearest Neighbors.

* We have used basics information of a person like Body Mass Index, Blood Pressure, No of pregnancy. So ultimately it’s a binary classification(i.e, 1(diabetic), 0(non- diabetic)). 
* The main aim of this project is to find out which method of classification will be most suitable for finding out the diabetic status of anyone. So we have compared the output accuracy of different classification methods with the use of different parameters like Accuracy, Precision, ROC curve, etc. 
* We are not aiming to get 100% accuracy that can be achieved by blood sugar test but this output will give chances of having diabetic getting positive results surely needs doctor’s concern. 

* Information about Dataset
